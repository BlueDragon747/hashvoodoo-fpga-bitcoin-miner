This is the bitstream for the ModMiner Quad board, for HashVoodoo using the Icarus Hashing Core.

To build, first open the icarus core, and synthesize it only, and copy the NGC file into this project. Then do a full build.

This builds in pure Xilinx ISE 14.1 for me. (no third party tools required).
